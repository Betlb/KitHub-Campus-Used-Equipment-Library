System Overview

The KitHub system is a web-based application designed to support temporary borrowing of campus equipment such as lab tools, cameras, and sports gear. It aims to enhance sustainability and reduce costs by allowing students to borrow instead of purchase rarely used equipment.
The selected use case for this assignment is Borrow Equipment. This is a core operation in the system and involves:
    • Students requesting an item,
    • The system evaluating the request using predefined borrowing strategies,
    • The administrator approving or rejecting the request.
The use case implements the Strategy Design Pattern to dynamically switch between borrowing rules based on user type or equipment category.

System Context

The KitHub system operates as a standalone web application designed for use within a university campus. It interacts primarily with two user types: students and administrators.
This system does not integrate with any external services or university databases in its MVP version, making it lightweight and easy to deploy. The only system boundaries include internal data validation and access restrictions based on roles.


Actors and Interactions:
Actor	Interaction Type	Purpose
Student	Web UI / Borrow Module	Requests to borrow available items
Administrator	Web UI / Admin Panel	Approves or denies borrow requests
System	Internal logic using Strategy Pattern	Selects borrowing strategy based on context (user or item type)
Database	MySQL (internal)	Stores borrow records, users, items
Context Diagram (Simplified)
    • Users interact via browser (client-side).
    • Frontend connects to backend controller.
    • Backend logic invokes appropriate borrowing strategy.
    • Database stores/updates state of requests and items.
