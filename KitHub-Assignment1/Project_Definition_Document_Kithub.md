# Project Definition Document

## 1. Project Name

KitHub – Campus Used Equipment Library

## 2. Project Summary

KitHub is a platform that allows university students to borrow various items such as lab tools, cameras, and sports equipment from a shared inventory. The system aims to increase resource efficiency by providing temporary access to items that students only need for a short period of time. This promotes sustainability, reduces costs, and supports both academic and extracurricular activities on campus.

## 3. Objectives

At the end of this project, we aim to develop a functional and user-friendly web application with the following key objectives:
• Enable secure registration and login for students and administrators.
• Allow students to browse and search the equipment inventory by category.
• Provide a borrowing system with request, approval, and return tracking.
• Support item status management (available / borrowed / overdue).
• Inform users about important actions (e.g., approval, return deadline).
• Allow administrators to add, remove, or update equipment entries.

Our goal is to support campus sustainability by maximizing equipment reuse and to reduce student costs by offering a reliable, easy-to-use equipment lending system.

## 4. Scope

**Includes:**

• Web-based platform accessible to students and administrators.
• Equipment list with category filters and availability status.
• Borrowing process: request → administrator approval → return.
• Notification system for approval status, return date reminders, etc.
• Simple administrative dashboard for product and user management.

**Excludes:**

• Physical inventory tracking technologies (e.g., RFID, barcode).
• Financial systems (fines, payments, deposits).
• Integration with university databases or third-party tools.

## 5. Target Audience

• Primary: University students (undergraduate and graduate) who need temporary access to a variety of equipment.
• Secondary: Faculty members, student associations, and campus clubs who can act as lenders or inspectors.

## 6. Key Features

• Secure user registration and login system
• Equipment catalog with filtering and search
• Borrow and return request flow with status tracking
• Notifications and reminders for actions and due dates
• Administrative tools for equipment management

## 7. Deliverables

• Functional web application hosted on GitHub
• Project documentation:
  - Project Definition Document
  - Project Plan Document
  - Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
• Software architecture diagram and description
• Design pattern–use case mapping matrix
• GitHub repository with individual contributions and commit history

## 8. Project Success Criteria

• The application processes borrow transactions without functional errors for at least 95% of test cases.
• All key features listed in the project description are fully implemented.
• Page load times and response actions are under 2 seconds under standard test conditions.
• The code is modular and well-documented enough that another developer can change a feature in an hour.
